# Assignment 4 Postmortem

## What's your name?
 Paige Craig


## How difficult was this assignment?
 Overall this assignment wasn't too crazy difficult, I just found it very hard to learn a lot of this on my own. It was super helpful when we did it in class but it wouldve been awesome to maybe have another lecture that went over more of it as well. I got pretty confused with the postman stuff and ended up not having enough time to finish the assignment with everything that is going on this week (ie tests, projects, etc).


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
 I learned a lot about ionic and it seems like a relatively usefull tool to have in the future. I would definitley love to explore a little more about it, and work from there.


## How could this assignment be improved?
 The only way that I feel like this assignment could be improved would just be with a little more guided assistance. Overall I didn't feel like it was too hard to do or over my head, I just felt slightly overwhelmed with everything that is going on this week and everything that was going on in this assignment as it dealt with a lot of different variables that I was not necessarily well versed in.
